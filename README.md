# Rust-Calculator
I just wanted to play with some mechanics of rust, and wrote this SIMPLEST 2 number calculator.

Thanks to [Sammy99jsp](https://github.com/Sammy99jsp) and [KibalchishTheCoder](https://github.com/Kibalchish47) for their implementation. Basically, I wanted to play and try to write it myself with specific mechanics from his(Kibalchish) code.
